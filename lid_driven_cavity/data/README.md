### **Description**
Lid-driven cavity flow is a standard CFD benchmark governed by the incompressible  
**2D Navier–Stokes equations**.

### **Geometry Families**
The dataset includes three geometry categories:

- **Harmonics**
- **NURBS**
- **SkelNetOn**

Each category represents a different parameterization of cavity geometry variations.
