## Overview
This dataset provides high-quality 3D point clouds of fully field-grown maize
plants acquired using terrestrial laser scanning. It captures detailed plant
structure, including leaf architecture and spatial arrangement, enabling
advanced 3D analysis beyond traditional 2D imagery. The dataset includes
diverse maize varieties with consistent labeling of leaves and stalks, supported
by manual quality control and rich metadata. It is designed to be AI-ready and
suitable for representation learning, plant phenotyping, and structural
analysis tasks.
