# Data Documentation: DrivAerNet++ for Surrogate Modeling

## 1. Overview
We present DrivAerNet++, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for aerodynamic car design. DrivAerNet++ comprises 8,000 diverse car designs modeled with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The dataset includes diverse car configurations such as fastback, notchback, and es-tateback, with different underbody and wheel designs to represent both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles.
